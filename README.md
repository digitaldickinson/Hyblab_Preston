## What is an Lower Super Output Area
Output Areas are built from clusters of adjacent unit postcodes in the United Kingdom and are the base unit for Census data releases. Due to their smaller size, Output Areas allow for a finer resolution of data analysis. *Lower Layer Super Output Areas* are built from groups of contiguous Output Areas and have been automatically generated to be as consistent in population size as possible, and typically contain from four to six Output Areas. They have an average of roughly 1,500 residents and 650 households. Measures of proximity (to give a reasonably compact shape) and social homogeneity (to encourage areas of similar social background) are also included.
